    "notes": "There are a limited number of operational satellites in orbit, placed there by different corpos and other factions. None of them use compatible systems or codes. An Orbital Lance Controller has links to one operational satellite which has sufficient energy in its banks to fire three strikes. This means that an Orbital Lance Controller can only ever be used three times and does not regain itâ€™s uses. \n\nThe laser strike that the Orbital Lance fires can be either focussed or wide. This allows you to specify any target of your choice from the huge to the small. You can choose a wide blast to destroy a settlement, or Mech convoy, or a pinpoint strike to kill a single person. The Orbital Lance only deals as much collateral damage as you want it to. The target you choose is killed or destroyed entirely.\n\nYou may only claim one Orbital Lance Controller per Union Crawler, others must be found in the wastelands. There are few of these just lying around!"
