    "description": "The 'BG-288' Jackhammer was commissioned by the Terrestrial Democratic Alliance and constructed by Thatcher Steel. The Jackhammer was built in response to a series of costly uranium mining accidents on off-world colonies, due to lax worker safety protocols, in which a slew of mining Mechs were destroyed in tunnel collapses and the worker pilots tragically killed. The reinforced chassis of the Jackhammer was designed to protect the Mech's expensive reactor and core systems in the event of an accident which immobilised or crushed the Mech. That it happened to also protect the worker pilot was of secondary consideration to the corpo.",

    "description": "The pinnacle of the Evantis range, the 'Mk3' Leviathan is currently the only general release Super Heavy Mech available to buy on the Corpo Net. Enormously powerful, it can be fitted with a veritable arsenal of lasers, missiles, and cannons, as well as enough Modules to make those shots count. It uses a modified reactor from a 1,000 tonne terraforming rig, and is so heavily armoured that nothing short of a tactical nuke can take it out. If you find yourself against one of these, you will either need a madcap plan under your belt to stop it or a good pair of running boots.",
